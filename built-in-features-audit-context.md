# Audit Context: Built-in Features & App References in Shopify Help Documentation

## Purpose
This file documents the context, plan, and findings for an audit of Shopify help documentation, focusing on:
- Clarity about what features are built-in with a Shopify subscription
- When merchants should use the Shopify App Store
- Ensuring only official Shopify apps are referenced, otherwise linking to App Store categories
- Incorporating up-to-date context from a provided CSV of built-in features

## Audit Plan
1. **Inventory and Categorize Existing Documentation**
   - Compile a list of all help articles mentioning Shopify features or apps.
2. **Integrate CSV Context on Built-in Features**
   - Use the CSV as the source of truth for built-in feature details and limitations.
3. **Review Built-in Feature Coverage**
   - Cross-check documentation with the CSV for accuracy and completeness.
4. **Clarify When to Use the Shopify App Store**
   - Ensure guidance is provided when built-in features are insufficient, with links to relevant App Store categories.
5. **Audit App References**
   - Only reference official Shopify apps; otherwise, link to App Store categories.
6. **Content Consistency and Clarity**
   - Use consistent language and clear next steps for merchants.
7. **Update and Standardize Templates**
   - Propose or update templates to clarify built-in vs. app-required features.
8. **Merchant Feedback Loop**
   - Review merchant feedback to identify recurring confusion.

## CSV Context

  - Identify gaps in coverage
  - Ensure accuracy about feature limitations

## Next Steps
