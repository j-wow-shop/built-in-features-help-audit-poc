6. **If apps are referenced, are they official Shopify apps? If not, is there a link to the relevant App Store category?**

   The documentation does not reference any apps, official or otherwise, related to Shopify Capital. There are no links to the relevant App Store category.

7. **Other notes or recommendations for improvement.**

   - Consider including information about the integration with other Shopify financial tools to provide a more comprehensive view of how Shopify Capital fits within the broader Shopify ecosystem.
   - Add details about the ability to top up funding, as mentioned in the CSV, to ensure users are aware of all available options.
   - Provide guidance or links to additional resources or apps in the Shopify App Store that could complement the use of Shopify Capital.
   - Ensure that any temporary changes, such as the pause on Term Loans, are clearly communicated with expected timelines or alternative options if available.
