Let's evaluate the documentation based on the provided criteria:

1. **Identification as a Built-in Feature:**
   - The documentation does not explicitly identify the B2B feature as a built-in feature included with Shopify Plus. It focuses more on customer accounts rather than the B2B capabilities specifically.

It does not cover the specific functionalities and limitations of the B2B feature as outlined in the CSV, such as pricing options, order management, and import/export capabilities.

3. **Up-to-date and Consistent Information:**
   - The information provided in the documentation is not directly related to the B2B feature described in the CSV. It focuses on customer accounts, which is a different aspect of Shopify's offerings. Therefore, it is not consistent with the CSV regarding the B2B feature.

4. **Gaps or Missing Features Compared to the CSV:**
   - The documentation does not cover any of the B2B-specific features mentioned in the CSV, such as company profiles, customized buying experiences, optimized workflows, or self-serve purchasing. It lacks information on wholesale features, order management, and additional B2B functionalities.

5. **Guidance on Using the Shopify App Store:**
   - The documentation does not provide guidance on when to use the Shopify App Store for B2B functionalities. It does not mention any apps or app categories related to B2B enhancements.

6. **Reference to Official Shopify Apps:**
   - There is no reference to apps in the documentation provided. Therefore, it does not address whether the apps are official Shopify apps or provide links to relevant App Store categories.

7. **Other Notes or Recommendations for Improvement:**

Additionally, including links to relevant App Store categories or specific apps would be beneficial for users seeking additional capabilities beyond the built-in features.

### File: `content/pages/en/manual/markets-new/backup-region.md`

Let's analyze the provided documentation based on your questions:

1. **Does the documentation clearly identify this as a built-in feature?**
   - The documentation does not explicitly identify the "Backup region in Markets" as a built-in feature. It describes how backup regions work within the context of Shopify Markets but does not explicitly state that it is a built-in feature of Shopify Plus or any specific Shopify plan.
